Welcome

Simple project designed to be a standard database docker for testing API's and code under development, facilitating a test environment in diverses databases, containing simple configurations and implementations.

&nbsp;

This README is intended to guide how this project is structured and should serve as a guide to help scale the project with current and future requirements. Think of it as a flexible set of rules that guide project decisions. While they can (and should) change over time, how should they be raised to trigger such changes: that means we will think/question ourselves before taking action that breaks any rational decision here. This is also effective in guiding how the PR works.
